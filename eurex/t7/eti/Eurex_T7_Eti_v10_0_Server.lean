# Eurex Exchange Enhanced Trading Interface v10.0

Generated from the binary model, with the proofs the model's rules call for: every record
decodes back to what was encoded; a message dispatch selects the message its type names;
a count is written from the list it counts; a length prefix is written from the bytes it frames;
and a packet read to the end of its data decodes to the messages that were written.

Text fields are kept byte for byte, padding included, so what is decoded encodes back unchanged.
Prices with implied decimals are proven as the integers on the wire.
