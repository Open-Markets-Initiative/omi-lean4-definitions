# Chicago Board Options Exchange Drop Copy v2.9

Generated from the Fix model, with the proofs its structure calls for: every message decodes back to
what was encoded; MsgType, and each field a message's arms are chosen by, selects the message it names;
BodyLength is written from the body and CheckSum from every byte before it.

Fields are read by tag wherever they stand, as Fix allows, and written in the order the model lists
them. A repeating group keeps its order: its count, then each entry led by its delimiter. A message
carrying a tag its model does not list is not read. Values are kept as their text, byte for byte.
